# Yearbook

# Context

The Yearbook was a year-end project for H1 students at HETIC school.

# Project Structure

Our project structure is based on a PHP controller file named KingKongController.php. This file contains various routes to connect the different pages of our website. The controller is responsible for handling the incoming requests and determining the appropriate actions to perform, such as rendering templates, retrieving data, and returning responses. By defining routes in the KingKongController.php file, we establish the mapping between URLs and the corresponding controller methods, allowing users to navigate and interact with the different pages of our site.

Class naming conventions

We have made an effort to use consistent class names throughout our project to improve readability and maintainability. By using meaningful and descriptive names for our classes, it becomes easier to understand their purpose and functionality at a glance. Additionally, we have provided comprehensive comments within the CSS files, documenting the different classes and their respective styles. These comments serve as a reference for developers, making it easier to navigate and modify the CSS codebase in the future. By employing consistent class naming conventions and providing thorough comments, we aim to enhance the overall clarity and maintainability of our project.

# Installation

"To install and run our website, please follow these steps:

Make sure you have Symfony and PHP installed on your machine.
Clone this GitHub repository to your computer.
In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute the 'composer install' command to install all the necessary dependencies.
Configure your database in the '.env' file.
Execute migrations using the 'php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate' command to set up the database structure.
Then, run 'php bin/console server:run' to launch the development server.
Open your browser and access the provided URL to view the site.
Make sure you also have the necessary HTML and CSS files in the appropriate directories to ensure the proper functioning of the site."

# Objectives
"Our ultimate goal is to integrate a database into our site to further enhance it, allowing for efficient storage and management of essential data to provide an even more personalized and functional user experience."
